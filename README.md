# Vst3HostSharp

Vst3HostSharp is a library that allows an audio host written in C# to interact with vst3 plugins conforming to the Steinberg SDK.

The interops are written in C++ and included in this package as both .dll and .dylib for Win/MacOS support.

A demo app (C#-Avalonia) is included to demonstrate how to use the library.
